1.4.2 Simulation and Modeling
• Utilise simulation software to model and simulate proposed designs.
• Where possible validate simulations using data from real experiments or values obtained
from published literature.
• Establish a comprehensive understanding of solver operations in simulation software and
physical models.
• Ensure proper licensing of all simulation software used. Provide clear citations and acknowledgment when using data from literature to validate models.
1.4.3 Experimental Validation
• Align with ongoing research efforts at Smart Materials & Surfaces Lab to begin experiments.
• Progressively work towards experiments at higher frequencies.
• Follow all lab safety protocols and receive proper training on equipment. Use appropriate protective equipment. Properly dispose of any hazardous materials. Respect intellectual property of lab and collaborators.
1.4.4 Environmental Sensing Development
• Develop algorithms for sensing, considering real-world scenarios.
• Be transparent about capabilities and limitations of sensing capabilities. Consider any potential for misuse.
1.4.5 Collaboration & Characterisation
• Collaborate with expert researchers to gain access and training on specialist lab equipment
1.4.6 Application of Metasurface Framework
• Design architectures for specific frequency regimes, focusing on molecule sensing, defect
detection, absorption, passive cooling, and active thermal energy conversion.
1.4.7 Lab-Scale Fabrication
• Initiate lab-scale demonstrations, tailoring the metasurface platform to elements that
contribute significantly to TPV system efficiency.
Use sustainable materials when possible. Properly dispose of waste. Ensure safe and responsible use of lab equipment.
1.4.8 Commercial Fabrication Consideration
• Evaluate viable manufacturing techniques, for consideration of routes to market.
 Consider environmental impact and sustainability of manufacturing at scale.
