Design and Fabricate ‘Scaled Up’ Devices (Year 1 and 2):

Aim: Create a dataset of metasurface designs and demonstrate experimental validation  

Objective 1a: Using forward design, create simulations well matched to external quantum efficiency measurements for a variety of PV cells beginning with Si and GaAs.

Quantify the match between target and attained absorptivity response curves in terms of overlapping areas and mean square error.

Objective 1b: Fabricate three proposed designs in year 1 (2024) using photolithography and other readily available techniques.

Use results from completed Metamaterial-SAW experiment to propose suitable sensing experiments for these devices.

Objective 2: Through simulation, demonstrate correspondence between scaled up and scaled down versions of unit cell geometries.

Seek to represent the mathematical relationship between geometrical features and resonant frequencies (wideband or narrowband), thereby demonstrating tunability.

‘Scaled down’ Fabrication and Characterisation (Year 2.5 to Year 3.5):

Aim: Expand the framework - design, fabrication, characterisation.

Objective 3: By end of year 3 (2026) fabricate three nano-structured metasurface designs using Nano Imprint Lithography (NIL), Focused-Ion Beam (FIB), or Electron Beam Lithography (EBL).

Objective 4: Characterise nanoscale structures and measure suppression of thermalisation loss in terms of efficiency gains of the metasurface-PV system compared to the standalone PV cells.
