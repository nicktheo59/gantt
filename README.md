Objective 1: Sense environment changes, with a focus on water and ice.
– Utilise resonance response in the presence of droplets, ice crystals and piezoelectric
acoustic waves.
• Objective 2: Measurement and detection of ice cracks.
– Draw parallels between photovoltaic defect detection.
• Aim: Develop a holistic design framework to equip a multi-functional [MM-SAW] device
with sensing capability.
Microwave to Infrared:
• Objective 1: Reject excess sub-bandgap photons by employing pass and stop bands;
passive cooling.
• Objective 2: Implement active thermal capture for thermoelectric conversion through
photon recycling.
• Aim: Expand the framework - design, fabrication, characterisation.
Infrared to Visible:
• Objective 1: Simulate enhanced photovoltaic efficiency through enhanced light absorption,
amorphous silicon is a suitable device-coupling-candidate.
• Objective 2: Investigate feasibility of enhanced efficiency through light capture and
(non-lossy) frequency conversion processes i.e. SHG.
• Aim: Expand the framework - exploration and design.
